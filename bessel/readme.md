Code for performin Hankel trasforms (called Bessel transform in the dyres papers)
- algorithm 588 for the hankel transform from ACM TOM
- rewrite in C of the python code of steven-murray from https://github.com/steven-murray/hankel/blob/master/hankel/hankel.py, which implemented Ogata's 2005 DE for Bessel integrals (H. Ogata, A Numerical Integration Formula Based on the Bessel Functions, Publications of the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences,vol. 41, no. 4, pp. 949-970, 2005.)

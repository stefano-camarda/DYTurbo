The files with the functions and subroutines of are located in 
./Routines/, wie the exception of the usr-files.  These are in 
this QCD-Pegasus base directory, together with the main routines.

For running with g77, go to ./Routines/ and execute  G77-obj.
This will produce the .o-files and move them to ./Objects1. 
The corresponding files for the Intel compiler are generated 
and moved to ./Objects2 by running  IFC-obj.
This needs to be done only once when installing the program.


Some sample main programs are provided. These are

- lh01tab  compiled by  G77-tab  for checking against the Les 
  Houches benchmark tables (see section 4.4 of the manual)

- evoltime  compiled by  G77-time  or  IFC-time  for checking
  the speed tables of section 6 of the manual)

- evolpol  compiled by  G77-pol, example for the polarized case

- evolmom  compiled by  G77-mom, example for the N-space option

The above compilations generate the executables  tablh01.x,
timeevol.x, polevol.x and momevol.x
